# Dashboard Folder Analysis (`tools/dashboard/`)

Scope: **only** `tools/dashboard/`. This is **not** the shipped OpenClaw Control UI in `ui/`; it is a **deployment-local Flask homelab dashboard** for monitoring AI infrastructure and related services.

---

## Summary

| Item                     | In `tools/dashboard/`?                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Custom Flask dashboard   | Yes — `app.py`                                 |
| Ranch Bot                | **No**                                         |

## 1. Folder Structure

**Active source (excluding backups/venv):**

| Path                                 | Role                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.py`                             | Main Flask application (~1,167 lines)                       |
| `dashboard_property_backup.sh`       | Snapshots `app.py` + `tools/property_manager/`              |
| `events.jsonl`                       | JSONL log of service/backup actions (May 2026)              |
| `.venv/`                             | Local Python venv (Flask, matplotlib, requests)             |
| `backups/`                           | Timestamped copies of `app.py` and property_manager bundles |
| `app.py.before-*`, `app.py.backup-*` | ~100+ iterative edit snapshots                              |

There are **no** separate HTML templates, CSS files, or JS modules. The UI is **inline HTML** built in Python.

---

## 2. Runtime Architecture

```
Browser → Flask (0.0.0.0:5051)
            ├── GET  /              → Single-page dashboard
            ├── POST /backup        → Create tar.gz backup
            └── GET  /graphs/<file> → Serve matplotlib PNGs
```

**Stack:** Python 3, Flask, matplotlib (Agg backend), requests, subprocess/shell probes.

**External data sources:**

| Source           | Path / Endpoint                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trend samples    | `~/ai/projects/openclaw/reports/trends.csv`            |
| AI summary drift | `~/ai/projects/openclaw/reports/home_ai_summary_*.txt` |
| Chart output     | `~/ai/projects/openclaw/reports/graphs/`               |
| Ollama provider  | `OPENCLAW_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`                             |
| Model host stats | Optional SSH via `OPENCLAW_M4_SSH_HOST`                |
| Trend collection | `tools/home_manager/collect_trends.sh`                 |

## 3. Current Dashboard Panels (live `app.py`)

### System Connectivity Check

- Reads latest `home_ai_summary_*.txt` for warning lines (failed, error, connection refused, notify poll failed).
- Classifies into **Gateway Communication Warning** or **Ollama Connectivity Warning**.
- Shows green “all connected” when no warnings.

### Intel Mini → M4 Model Server

- Probes the canonical `OPENCLAW_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` via `/api/tags`.
- Lists model count, primary model (`gpt-oss:20b` preferred), detected model names.

### M4 AI Server Health

- Treats Ollama API reachability as the authoritative model-server health.
- Optionally connects to the model host using `OPENCLAW_M4_SSH_HOST`,
  `OPENCLAW_M4_SSH_USER`, and `OPENCLAW_M4_SSH_KEY`.
- Remote Python collects: memory (vm_stat), Ollama process/CPU, uptime.
- An SSH metrics failure does not mark a reachable Ollama API offline.

### Model Status

- Performs live checks for six configured models:
  - `llama3.2:3b`, `hermes3:8b`, `gemma3:12b`, `nomic-embed-text:latest`, `gpt-oss:20b`, `glm-4.7-flash:latest`
- Generation models use `/api/generate`; embedding models use `/api/embed`.
- The default page uses the inventory for a fast installed/available status.
- **Run Live Model Tests** opens an immediate progress page, then performs
  generation and embedding calls through `/api/model-health/live`.
- When the server is unreachable, the dashboard shows one server-level failure
  and skips redundant per-model failures.
- Live checks use the canonical Ollama timeout and do not block normal page
  loads.
- An installed model that exceeds the live-test timeout is shown as a
  performance warning rather than a missing-model failure.

### AI Routing Telemetry

- Reads recent observed model usage, deployment drift, failures, and failovers
  from the AI Intelligence database.
- The development reporter prefers
  `~/.openclaw/credentials/ai-intelligence-dev.env`; the generic
  `ai-intelligence.env` remains a fallback.
- `openclaw-ai-routing-telemetry.timer` refreshes the report every eight
  minutes. The dashboard marks reports older than ten minutes stale, leaving a
  two-minute scheduling margin.
- The panel displays report age and marks reports older than ten minutes stale.
- Report artifacts are
  `reports/ai_intelligence/routing-telemetry-latest.{json,txt}`.

### Trend Charts

- Button: **Collect Fresh Sample + Refresh Charts** → runs `collect_trends.sh`.
- `openclaw-dashboard-trends.timer` collects a development sample hourly.
- The collector uses the canonical Ollama and optional model-host SSH settings.
- Charts from last 24 `trends.csv` rows:
  - Intel Mini Ollama latency
  - Intel + M4 memory usage
  - M4 CPU, disk, Ollama response time
- Dark-theme matplotlib PNGs served from `/graphs/`.

### Storage Health

- The development dashboard labels its local root filesystem as
  **Development VM Internal Disk** so it cannot be mistaken for production.
- A separate read-only Intel Mini probe reports the production root
  filesystem usage, complete physical internal-drive capacity, root
  allocation, and capacity outside the root allocation.
- External AI storage remains a separate card with total, used, free, and
  percentage values.
- When `/mnt/ai-storage` is not local to the development host, the dashboard
  performs a read-only SSH probe of the Intel Mini using
  `OPENCLAW_INTELMINI_STORAGE_HOST`, `OPENCLAW_INTELMINI_STORAGE_USER`, and
  `OPENCLAW_INTELMINI_STORAGE_KEY`.
- Remote storage commands are limited to `findmnt`, `df`, and `lsblk`; they do
  not mount, modify, restart, resize, or write to the Intel Mini.
- Missing or unmounted storage is shown as **Not mounted on this host**, not as
  `0%` usage or a parser failure.
- Internal and external disk percentages have separate trend columns. Missing
  external samples remain blank and are not plotted as zero.
- The hourly development collector uses the same read-only remote probe when
  the external storage is not mounted locally.
- Thresholds: Healthy &lt;80%, Warning 80–90%, Critical &gt;90%.
- Disk usage over time chart from `trends.csv`.

### Reference Document Storage

- PostgreSQL is authoritative for reference-document metadata. The
  `reference_documents` registry records the external storage root, relative
  path, original filename, category, MIME type, title, notes, byte size,
  SHA-256 checksum, page count, encryption state, source host, and storage
  state.
- PDF binaries remain on the Intel Mini external drive under
  `/mnt/ai-storage/openclaw-documents`; the development VM does not mount that
  production storage.
- Remote uploads first land in
  `/mnt/ai-storage/.openclaw-upload-staging` with a random temporary name.
  The Intel Mini recalculates SHA-256, rejects checksum mismatches and
  conflicting destinations, and uses an atomic rename into the final library.
- Final filenames include a checksum prefix. An existing PostgreSQL record
  with the same storage root and SHA-256 is treated as a duplicate and is not
  uploaded again.
- If PostgreSQL metadata recording fails after a newly created file is placed,
  the route removes only that newly created file. Existing matching files are
  never removed by compensation logic.
- The migration helper refuses databases whose names do not end in `_dev`.
  Production schema migration remains a separate, explicitly approved
  deployment step.

### Manual Backup

- **Backup Now** → POST `/backup`.
- Shows latest verified backup from `~/openclaw-dashboard-backups/`.

### Backup & Recovery Center

- Development reads the Intel Mini backup inventory and QNAP capacity through
  the same approved SSH identity used by the external-storage health probe.
- Inventory probes are read-only. They inspect archive metadata, mount state,
  and capacity without mounting storage in the development VM.
- The M4 Time Machine card uses a read-only SSH probe of `tmutil status`,
  `tmutil latestbackup`, and `tmutil destinationinfo`; it never starts or
  changes a Time Machine backup.
- Time Machine is expected to back up daily. The dashboard reports healthy
  through 30 hours, warning from 30–48 hours, and critical after 48 hours.
- **Run Verification Now** validates the latest remote archives and available
  SHA-256 files read-only, then stores the resulting report in the development
  report directory.
- Production and Dashboard/PropertyManager backup write actions are disabled
  in the development dashboard.
- **Run Development Backup Now** is the only manual write action exposed in
  development. It requires an operator confirmation and uses the dedicated
  development-backup script and SSH identity.
- The development backup destination defaults to the Intel Mini Tailscale
  address and does not automatically delete older remote backups.

### Live Resource Monitor

- CPU (`top`), RAM (`free`), disk (`df`), Docker container count.

---

## 4. Service Health (defined but not rendered)

`build_system_health()` checks:

- OpenClaw Gateway (`openclaw-gateway.service`)
- OpenClaw Listener (`openclaw-listener.service`)
- Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, Home Assistant, Scrypted
- Ollama API (`curl` to `:11434/api/tags`)

**Note:** `services = build_system_health()` is called in `home()` but the result is **never rendered**. Service status UI was likely removed; only drift warnings remain in the connectivity panel.

---

## 5. Backup Automation

### In-dashboard (`POST /backup`)

Creates `~/openclaw-dashboard-backups/openclaw-dashboard-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz` containing:

- `tools/dashboard/app.py`
- `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-dashboard.service` (if present)

Does **not** back up the full OpenClaw repo or `openclaw backup` state.

### Property backup script (`dashboard_property_backup.sh`)

Copies to `tools/dashboard/backups/propertymanager_app_backups/backup-<stamp>/`:

- `tools/dashboard/app.py`
- `tools/property_manager/` (entire directory)

### Events log (`events.jsonl`)

Records backup OK/ERROR, gateway/voice/docker restart attempts (May 2026).

---

## 6. PropertyManager — Not in Current Dashboard

`dashboard_property_backup.sh` bundles PropertyManager, but **current `app.py` has no PropertyManager routes or UI**.

Backed-up `property_manager/propertymanager-summary.py` (sibling under `tools/`) is a **standalone script** that:

- Reads `property_tasks.csv` and `maintenance_log.csv`
- Computes due tasks and overdue maintenance
- Writes reports to `reports/property_manager/`

**No integration** with the live Flask dashboard today.

---

## 7. Features Not Present in `tools/dashboard/`

Searched current `app.py` and backups — **not found** in this folder:

| Feature                                   | Status                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ranch Bot                                 | Absent                                        |
| Telegram polling                          | Absent                                        |
| Time Machine monitoring                   | Absent                                        |
| Daily Executive Briefing                  | Absent                                        |
| Honcho memory panel                       | Removed (seen in `app.py.bad-honcho-route-*`) |
| Tab navigation (8 tabs)                   | Removed (seen in `app.py.before-fill-tabs-*`) |
| HA / PostgreSQL / Docker dedicated tabs   | Removed                                       |
| Temperature / Scrypted / benchmark panels | Removed (older snapshots only)                |

Those live elsewhere under `tools/` (watchdog, briefing, system_manager, etc.), not in `tools/dashboard/`.

---

## 8. Evolution (from snapshots)

The folder shows heavy iterative editing (May–Jun 2026):

| Phase     | Changes                                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early May | Ollama host `192.168.50.117` → later `127.0.0.1`                                                |
| May 21    | Backup UI, resource monitor, M4 panel, benchmarks                                               |
| May 25–27 | Service health, tab bar (8 tabs), trend refresh                                                 |
| May 28    | Honcho panel added then removed                                                                 |
| May 30    | Dashboard hang bypass, drift warnings                                                           |
| Jun 2     | Storage charts, M4 memory/CPU metrics                                                           |
| Jun 4     | PropertyManager UI planned (`backup-before-propertymanager-ui`) but **not in current `app.py`** |
| Jun 9     | PropertyManager backup bundles created                                                          |

Current `app.py` is a **simplified single-page** layout vs. earlier multi-tab versions.

---

## 9. Dependencies and Deployment

- **Port:** `5051` (`app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5051)`)
- **systemd:** `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-dashboard.service` supervises
  the WSGI master and restarts it after failure.
- **venv:** `.venv-dashboard` uses the pinned dependencies in
  `tools/dashboard/requirements.txt`.
- **Configured endpoints:** Ollama and optional model-host SSH use environment
  variables; deployment-local repository and backup paths remain fixed.

---

## 10. WSGI Runtime and Reliability

The dashboard is served by Gunicorn rather than Flask's built-in development
server. `tools/dashboard/wsgi.py` exports the application without invoking
`app.run()`. The pinned runtime and default policy are:

- Gunicorn 26.0.0;
- two `gthread` workers with four threads each;
- a 300-second request timeout for operator-triggered model and backup checks;
- 45-second graceful shutdown;
- worker recycling after 1,000 requests with jitter;
- access and error output captured by the systemd journal;
- no application preloading, so a failed worker does not share mutable startup
  state with its replacement.

The systemd unit restarts a failed master, reloads with `HUP`, and stops
gracefully with `SIGQUIT`. Supported user-service protections include
`NoNewPrivileges`, private temporary storage, read-only system directories,
kernel-tunable and control-group protection, and SUID/SGID restrictions.
`ProtectKernelModules` is intentionally omitted because the development VM's
user-service environment cannot apply that directive.

The Flask `app.run()` block remains a rollback-only direct launch path. It must
not be the normal production runtime.

---

## 11. AI Model Scorecard Review Queue

The deployment-local dashboard includes an operator review surface at
`/ai-scorecard`.

Shared navigation links to the read-only **All Models Scorecard**. The
actionable **Review Queue** button appears only inside the All Models page,
keeping review navigation available without placing a mutation-oriented link
on every dashboard page.

The All Models Scorecard reads the authoritative model registry and lists every
registered local and cloud model, including production, fallback, evaluation,
and watch entries. Promotion-eligible winners from the selected evaluation are
shown separately and must not be presented as the complete model inventory.

The review workflow:

- discovers immutable `evaluation-lab-*.json` reports and displays the oldest
  undecided pipeline first;
- advances to the next archived undecided pipeline after a decision;
- links each promotion-eligible recommendation to a pipeline-specific,
  read-only evidence view;
- shows benchmark prompts, model responses, deterministic validation, reviewer
  scores, and findings when those source reports exist;
- labels fixture-only or missing evidence and warns the operator not to treat it
  as a real recommendation;
- presents direct Approve and Reject actions with optional audit notes;
- treats the decision-button click as confirmation;
- binds the submitted action to the pipeline shown on the page and passes the
  exact validated Evaluation Lab report path to the decision tool, so stale
  pages cannot decide another evaluation;
- restricts mutations to loopback requests;
- returns successful decisions to the clean review URL;
- preserves completed decisions and shows an explicit empty queue when no
  evidence-backed evaluation remains;
- leaves model routing disabled and does not modify the production model.

Promotion remains a separate action with explicit decision-ID confirmation.
The review queue does not generate synthetic evaluations. A new Evaluation Lab
report becomes the next review item.

## 12. RanchBrain Database

The deployment-local RanchBrain dashboard reads PostgreSQL settings from the
first available configured credential file:

1. `OPENCLAW_RANCHBRAIN_ENV_FILE`, defaulting to
   `~/.openclaw/credentials/chat-agent.env`;
2. development fallback
   `~/.openclaw/credentials/ai-intelligence-dev.env`.

This keeps RanchBrain on the approved development database and prevents a
silent fallback to an unrelated PostgreSQL port.

Before querying notes, the dashboard checks for
`public.long_term_memory`. If the authoritative RanchBrain schema has not been
initialized, the page returns a clear development-setup notice rather than a
raw database error. The dashboard does not infer a schema or copy production
data.

The authoritative RanchBrain memory schema is versioned at
`tools/ranchbrain/migrations/001_create_long_term_memory.sql`. It creates the
shared memory fields required by the RanchBrain capture, duplicate detection,
review, approval, rejection, search, and dashboard consumers. Development
applies this migration only to `openclaw_ai_dev`; it does not copy production
records.

The Knowledge Status panel presents its review-queue link as a visible primary
button. Each approved note also has a direct **Reject Mistaken Note** POST
action for correcting test or operator mistakes. Rejection moves either a
pending or approved note to `ranchbrain_rejected`, archives its source
Markdown, and restores the previous file location and status if the database
transaction fails.

### Scorecard routes

| Route                                       | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `GET /ai-scorecard?view=all`                | Main all-model scorecard and history  |
| `GET /ai-scorecard`                         | Current pending review or empty queue |
| `GET /ai-scorecard/evidence/<benchmark_id>` | Read-only decision evidence           |
| `POST /ai-scorecard/approve`                | Record pipeline approval              |
| `POST /ai-scorecard/reject`                 | Record pipeline rejection             |
| `POST /ai-scorecard/promote`                | Promote an approved scorecard         |
| `POST /ranchbrain/knowledge/reject`         | Reject approved mistaken knowledge    |

## 13. Gaps and Observations

1. **Dead code:** `build_system_health()` result is unused; service grid is missing from UI.
2. **Performance:** Deep model checks are operator-triggered so normal dashboard
   loads remain responsive.
3. **PropertyManager:** Backup script exists; UI integration was started but not shipped.
4. **Not product OpenClaw:** Separate from `ui/` Control UI and Gateway `:18789`.
5. **Backup clutter:** 100+ `app.py.before-*` files and 12 propertymanager bundles dominate the folder.
6. **Scope boundary:** Ranch Bot, briefing, Time Machine, Telegram polling are **outside** this folder.
