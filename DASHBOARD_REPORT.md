# Dashboard Folder Analysis (`tools/dashboard/`)

Scope: **only** `tools/dashboard/`. This is **not** the shipped OpenClaw Control UI in `ui/`; it is a **deployment-local Flask homelab dashboard** for monitoring AI infrastructure and related services.

---

## Summary

| Item                     | In `tools/dashboard/`?                         |

## 1. Folder Structure

**Active source (excluding backups/venv):**

| Path                                 | Role                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.py`                             | Main Flask application (~1,167 lines)                       |
| `dashboard_property_backup.sh`       | Snapshots `app.py` + `tools/property_manager/`              |
| `events.jsonl`                       | JSONL log of service/backup actions (May 2026)              |
| `.venv/`                             | Local Python venv (Flask, matplotlib, requests)             |
| `backups/`                           | Timestamped copies of `app.py` and property_manager bundles |
| `app.py.before-*`, `app.py.backup-*` | ~100+ iterative edit snapshots                              |

There are **no** separate HTML templates, CSS files, or JS modules. The UI is **inline HTML** built in Python.

---

## 2. Runtime Architecture

```
Browser → Flask (0.0.0.0:5051)
            ├── GET  /              → Single-page dashboard
            ├── POST /backup        → Create tar.gz backup
            └── GET  /graphs/<file> → Serve matplotlib PNGs
```

**Stack:** Python 3, Flask, matplotlib (Agg backend), requests, subprocess/shell probes.

**External data sources:**

| Source           | Path / Endpoint                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trend samples    | `~/ai/projects/openclaw/reports/trends.csv`            |
| AI summary drift | `~/ai/projects/openclaw/reports/home_ai_summary_*.txt` |
| Chart output     | `~/ai/projects/openclaw/reports/graphs/`               |
| Ollama (local)   | `http://127.0.0.1:11434`                               |
| M4 Mac (remote)  | SSH via Tailscale `100.104.100.96`                     |
| Trend collection | `tools/home_manager/collect_trends.sh`                 |

---

## 3. Current Dashboard Panels (live `app.py`)

### System Connectivity Check

- Reads latest `home_ai_summary_*.txt` for warning lines (failed, error, connection refused, notify poll failed).
- Classifies into **Gateway Communication Warning** or **Ollama Connectivity Warning**.
- Shows green “all connected” when no warnings.

### Intel Mini → M4 Model Server

- Probes `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags`.
- Lists model count, primary model (`gpt-oss:20b` preferred), detected model names.

### M4 AI Server Health

- SSH to M4 (`andrewgraves@100.104.100.96`) with `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_openclaw_m4`.
- Remote Python collects: memory (vm_stat), Ollama process/CPU, uptime.
- Local Ollama API status and response time.

### Model Status

- Live inference test for 6 models via `/api/generate`:
  - `llama3.2:3b`, `hermes3:8b`, `gemma3:12b`, `nomic-embed-text:latest`, `gpt-oss:20b`, `glm-4.7-flash:latest`
- 30s timeout per model; runs **on every page load** (can be slow).

### Trend Charts

- Button: **Collect Fresh Sample + Refresh Charts** → runs `collect_trends.sh`.
- Charts from last 24 `trends.csv` rows:
  - Intel Mini Ollama latency
  - Intel + M4 memory usage
  - M4 CPU, disk, Ollama response time
- Dark-theme matplotlib PNGs served from `/graphs/`.

### Storage Health

- Live `df` for `/` and `/mnt/ai-storage`.
- Thresholds: Healthy &lt;80%, Warning 80–90%, Critical &gt;90%.
- Disk usage over time chart from `trends.csv`.

### Manual Backup

- **Backup Now** → POST `/backup`.
- Shows latest verified backup from `~/openclaw-dashboard-backups/`.

### Live Resource Monitor

- CPU (`top`), RAM (`free`), disk (`df`), Docker container count.

---

## 4. Service Health (defined but not rendered)

`build_system_health()` checks:

- OpenClaw Gateway (`openclaw-gateway.service`)
- OpenClaw Listener (`openclaw-listener.service`)
- Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, Home Assistant, Scrypted
- Ollama API (`curl` to `:11434/api/tags`)

**Note:** `services = build_system_health()` is called in `home()` but the result is **never rendered**. Service status UI was likely removed; only drift warnings remain in the connectivity panel.

---

## 5. Backup Automation

### In-dashboard (`POST /backup`)

Creates `~/openclaw-dashboard-backups/openclaw-dashboard-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz` containing:

- `tools/dashboard/app.py`
- `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-dashboard.service` (if present)

Does **not** back up the full OpenClaw repo or `openclaw backup` state.

### Property backup script (`dashboard_property_backup.sh`)

Copies to `tools/dashboard/backups/propertymanager_app_backups/backup-<stamp>/`:

- `tools/dashboard/app.py`
- `tools/property_manager/` (entire directory)

### Events log (`events.jsonl`)

Records backup OK/ERROR, gateway/voice/docker restart attempts (May 2026).

---

## 6. PropertyManager — Not in Current Dashboard

`dashboard_property_backup.sh` bundles PropertyManager, but **current `app.py` has no PropertyManager routes or UI**.

Backed-up `property_manager/propertymanager-summary.py` (sibling under `tools/`) is a **standalone script** that:

- Reads `property_tasks.csv` and `maintenance_log.csv`
- Computes due tasks and overdue maintenance
- Writes reports to `reports/property_manager/`

**No integration** with the live Flask dashboard today.

---

## 7. Features Not Present in `tools/dashboard/`

Searched current `app.py` and backups — **not found** in this folder:

| Feature                                   | Status                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ranch Bot                                 | Absent                                        |
| Telegram polling                          | Absent                                        |
| Time Machine monitoring                   | Absent                                        |
| Daily Executive Briefing                  | Absent                                        |
| Honcho memory panel                       | Removed (seen in `app.py.bad-honcho-route-*`) |
| Tab navigation (8 tabs)                   | Removed (seen in `app.py.before-fill-tabs-*`) |
| HA / PostgreSQL / Docker dedicated tabs   | Removed                                       |
| Temperature / Scrypted / benchmark panels | Removed (older snapshots only)                |

Those live elsewhere under `tools/` (watchdog, briefing, system_manager, etc.), not in `tools/dashboard/`.

## 8. Evolution (from snapshots)

The folder shows heavy iterative editing (May–Jun 2026):

| Phase     | Changes                                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early May | Ollama host `192.168.50.117` → later `127.0.0.1`                                                |
| May 21    | Backup UI, resource monitor, M4 panel, benchmarks                                               |
| May 25–27 | Service health, tab bar (8 tabs), trend refresh                                                 |
| May 28    | Honcho panel added then removed                                                                 |
| May 30    | Dashboard hang bypass, drift warnings                                                           |
| Jun 2     | Storage charts, M4 memory/CPU metrics                                                           |
| Jun 4     | PropertyManager UI planned (`backup-before-propertymanager-ui`) but **not in current `app.py`** |
| Jun 9     | PropertyManager backup bundles created                                                          |

Current `app.py` is a **simplified single-page** layout vs. earlier multi-tab versions.

---

## 9. Dependencies and Deployment

- **Port:** `5051` (`app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5051)`)
- **systemd:** Expected unit at `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-dashboard.service`
- **venv:** `tools/dashboard/.venv` (Flask, matplotlib, numpy, requests)
- **Hardcoded paths:** `~/ai/projects/openclaw`, `~/openclaw-dashboard-backups`, M4 Tailscale IP, SSH key path

---

## 10. Gaps and Observations

1. **Dead code:** `build_system_health()` result is unused; service grid is missing from UI.
2. **Performance:** Six live Ollama tests on every page load can make the dashboard slow.
3. **PropertyManager:** Backup script exists; UI integration was started but not shipped.
4. **Not product OpenClaw:** Separate from `ui/` Control UI and Gateway `:18789`.
5. **Backup clutter:** 100+ `app.py.before-*` files and 12 propertymanager bundles dominate the folder.
6. **Scope boundary:** Ranch Bot, briefing, Time Machine, Telegram polling are **outside** this folder.
